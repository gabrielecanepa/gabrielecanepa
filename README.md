I'm a software engineer from [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa), a beautiful city on the sea of northern Italy ☀️🌊󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧🇮🇹 

I've been developing websites since I was 13 and, 󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿after studying engineering in my hometown, I moved to Lisbon and turned my passion for programming into my new profession. I'm currently based in Italy, working for [Algolia](https://algolia.com) and on solo projects. 

Contact me if you have any proposal for a collaboration, I'm always happy to hear smart ideas 👋
