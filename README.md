I'm a freelance software engineer from [Genova](https://goo.gl/maps/8zXJRARPsCyVtW149), a historical city on the sea of northern Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

I've been developing websites since I was just more than a kid and, after studying management engineering in my hometown, I moved to Lisbon and turned my passion for programming into my profession. Today I'm an independent tech expert dedicated to delivering tailor-made solutions to organizations of any scale.
