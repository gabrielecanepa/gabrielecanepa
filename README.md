I'm a freelance software engineer from [Genova](https://goo.gl/maps/8zXJRARPsCyVtW149), a historical city on the sea of northern Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

I've been developing websites since I was young and, after studying management engineering in my hometown, I moved to Lisbon and turned my passion for programming into my profession. Today I'm an independent tech expert dedicated to delivering solutions to organizations of all scales.
