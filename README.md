## _Ciao!_

I'm a software engineer from [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa), a beautiful city on the sea of northern Italy ☀️🌊󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧🇮🇹 

I've been developing websites since I was 13 and, 󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿after studying engineering in my hometown, I moved to Lisbon and turned my passion for programming into new profession. I'm currently based in Italy, working remotely for [Algolia](https://algolia.com) and on solo projects.

[Ping me](mailto:hey@gabrielecanepa.com) if you wanna have a chat, I'm always happy to hear new ideas 👋
