I'm a software developer from [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa), a beautiful city on the sea of northern Italy, land of immigrants and explorers ☀️🌊󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧🇮🇹 

I've been developing websites since I was 13 and, 󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿after studying engineering in my hometown, I moved to Lisbon and turned my passion for programming into my new profession. I now work as freelance software developer and project manager, and I'm an invited teacher at [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon), an international school ranked as world's best programming bootcamp. 

I use GitHub :octocat: every day to plan, design, develop, manage and scale any kind of project and web-related business. Contact me if you have any proposal for a collaboration, I'm always happy to hear smart ideas. See ya!
