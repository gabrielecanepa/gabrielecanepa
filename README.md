I'm a software engineer from [Genova](https://goo.gl/maps/8zXJRARPsCyVtW149), a beautiful historical city on the sea of northern Italy ☀️🌊󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧🇮🇹

I've been developing websites since I was a kid and, 󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿after studying engineering in my hometown, I moved to Lisbon and turned my passion for programming into new profession. I'm currently based in Italy, working remotely for [Algolia](https://algolia.com) and on solo projects.
